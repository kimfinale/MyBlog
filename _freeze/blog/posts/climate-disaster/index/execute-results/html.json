Gates begins by laying out the scope of the problem, explaining that the world needs to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to zero to avoid a catastrophe. I've compiled important numbers from the book to understand the climate change issues.\n\n-   51 Billion Tonnes: This is the amount of greenhouse gases, measured in CO2 equivalent ($\\mathrm{CO_{2}e}$), that humanity adds to the atmosphere every year.\n\n-   Zero: According to Bill Gates, we need to bring this number down to zero to avoid a climate disaster. And he thinks it is possible through our technological advances. Watch his TED talk, [Innovating to zero!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaF-fq2Zn7I&t=999s). He is a great speaker!\n\n| Percentage | Item                        |\n|------------|-----------------------------|\n| 27%        | How we generate electricity |\n| 31%        | How we make things          |\n| 18%        | How we grow our food        |\n| 16%        | How we move around          |\n| 6%         | How we keep warm or cool    |\n",
